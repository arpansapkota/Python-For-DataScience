The interpreter reads a Python expression or statement, also called the source code, and verifies that it is well formed.As soon as the interpreter encounters error, it halts translation with an error message.\n","\n","2.

This byte code is next sent to another software component, called the Python virtual  machine  (PVM),  where  it  is  executed.
